    People come here for the cultural experience and not just for the Southern cooking. If I want Southern cooking, I’ll go to Golden Corral, but people come here for the flavor, the seasoning, the different types of food, like our pig feet.
    Entering as strangers, guests often crowd at the heavy wooden table and talk to people they have never met and leave feeling as if they had known each other for years. It is a spirit that Fleming embodies and emanates into the Jim & Samella’s House experience.
